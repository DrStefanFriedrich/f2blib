/**
 * This package is the main entry point. It contains a factory {@link org.f2blib.FunctionEvaluationFactory}
 * for obtaining a {@link org.f2blib.FunctionEvaluationProvider} provider which, in turn, can be used to
 * obtain an implementation of a {@link org.f2blib.FunctionEvaluationKernel}.
 * The {@link org.f2blib.FunctionEvaluationKernel} is the main interface used to load function definitions into
 * the kernel and evaluate them.
